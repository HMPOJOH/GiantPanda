      <p>
        <strong>THE</strong> Giant Panda Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin:
        dàxióngmāo,[5] also known as the panda bear or simply the panda, is a
        bear[6] native to south central China.[1] It is characterised by large,
        black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body.

<p>Hello</p>

      <img src="images/Grosser_Panda.JPG" />
      <p>
        The name "giant panda" is <b>sometimes</b> used to distinguish it from
        the red panda, a neighboring musteloid.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though it belongs to the order <b>Carnivora</b>, the giant panda is a
        folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its
        diet.[7]
      </p>

      <p>
        Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild
        tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion.
      </p>

      <p>
        In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves,
        oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food
      </p>

      <p>
        The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly
        in Sichuan, <b>but also in</b> neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu.[10] As a
        result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda
        has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived, and it is
        a conservation-reliant vulnerable species.[11][12] A 2007 report showed
        239 pandas living in captivity inside China and another 27 outside the
        country.[13] As of December 2014, 49 giant pandas lived in captivity
        outside China, living in 18 zoos in 13 different countries.[14] Wild
        population estimates vary; one estimate shows that there are about 1,590
        individuals living in the wild,[13] while a 2006 study via DNA analysis
        estimated that this figure could be as high as 2,000 to 3,000.[15] Some
        reports also show that the number of giant pandas in the wild is on the
        rise.[16] In March 2015, conservation news site Mongabay stated that the
        wild giant panda population had increased by 268, or 16.8%, to
        1,864.[17] In 2016, the IUCN reclassified the species from "endangered"
        to "vulnerable",[12] affirming decade-long efforts to save the panda.

      <p>
        While the dragon has often served as China's national symbol,
        internationally the giant panda has often filled this role. As such, it
        is becoming widely used within China in international contexts, for
        example, appearing since 1982 on gold panda bullion coins and as one of
        the five Fuwa mascots of the Beijing Olympics.

  Embryos may be created by in vitro fertilization (IVF) with gametes from a male and female of the species to be reproduced. They may also be created by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) into an egg cell of another species, creating a cloned embryo that transferred into the uterus of yet another species. This technique was used for the experiment of panda fetuses in a cat mentioned in techniques for evercoming rejection.[11] In this experiment, nuclei from cells taken from abdominal muscles of giant pandas were transferred to egg cells of rabbits and, in turn, transferred into the uterus of cat together with cat embryos. Concomitant use of SCNT and interspecific pregnancy has also been speculated to potentially recreate the mammoth species, for example by taking genetic material from mammoth specimens preserved in permafrost and transferring it into egg cells and subsequently the uterus of an elephant.[16][17]
